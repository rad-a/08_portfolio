# Updated  Portfolio

The objective of this assignment is to improve my original [portfolio](https://github.com/rad-a/first_portfolio) by incorporating some of the new skills I have gained, such as JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, and a more in-depth knowledge of CSS. 

My updated portfolio can be found [here](https://rad-a.github.io/portfolio/).

## Requirements
- Updated portfolio featuring project 1 and two exemplary homework assignments.

- Update GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring project 1 and two exemplary assignments.

- Updated resume

- Updated LinkedIn profile

## Portfolio Instructions

### Updated Portfolio
Your updated site should have the following content:

- Your name

- Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number

- A link to a PDF of your resume

- A list of projects. For each project, make sure you have the following:

- Project title

- Link to the deployed version

- Link to the GitHub repository

- Screenshot of the deployed application

#### Design
Your site should look "polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

- Mobile-first design

- Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

- Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.
